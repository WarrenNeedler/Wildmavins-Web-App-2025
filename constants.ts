export const TERMS_TEXT = `TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Introduction
Welcome to the Terms of Service ("Terms") for the Wildmavins Global Membership Club, a platform facilitating luxury product and experience transactions through membership and tokenized digital assets (the "Platform"). The Platform and any content, tools, documentation, features and functionality offered on or through the Platform are collectively referred to as the "Services."

The Runda Lab Holdings Limited ("The Runda Lab", "Wildmavins", the "Company" "we," "us," or "our") operates the Platform. We are an exempted company incorporated and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands, with a registered address at PO Box 10008 Willow House, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands KY1-1001.

These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read these Terms carefully, as they include important information about your legal rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.

For purposes of these Terms, "you" and "your" means you as the user of the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity then "you" includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that:

you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and
you agree to these Terms on the entity's behalf.
For inquiries, please contact us at contact@therundalab.com.

2. Changes to the Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. Any changes will take effect upon posting to our Platform, with the updated effective date indicated. Your continued use of the Services following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly.

For the avoidance of doubt, terms not defined in these Terms shall, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, have the meaning given them in the Privacy Policy or any stated applicable agreement.

3. Account Registration and Security
To access certain Services, you may be required to register an account. When creating an account, you must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your account credentials, and for any activities or transactions conducted through your account. We are not liable for any unauthorized use of your account.

We reserve the right to refuse registration, suspend, or terminate your account at our sole discretion, without notice or liability, in the event of any breach of these Terms or applicable law.

4. Membership Structure
Wildmavins operates on a membership-based model, and access to that membership can be acquired by purchasing blockchain based Non-Fungible Tokens (the "NFTs"). Membership tiers are as follows:

Founders Club: Limited to 1,000 members, providing all-access benefits including priority access to events, products, and exclusive voting rights on key ecosystem decisions.
Category Clubs: Each club may represent specific categories of products or experiences (e.g., Bourbon, Gin, Fashion, Timepieces, Experiences) and will be limited to a certain number of members per category, offering category-specific access and exclusive experiences.
Membership NFTs are non-transferable, except via a smart contract on the blockchain. A transfer of ownership shall prompt new account creation requirements and requires new Know Your Customer verification following transfer of the NFT. We will update our system for tracking change of ownership and ensuring that previous accounts are not used by new purchasers/transferers. All benefits, privileges, and fees associated with membership may be modified at our discretion.

Annual Fees
While there are no annual fees for the first year of membership, we reserve the right to implement annual membership fees at any time following the first anniversary of the date on which the Founders Club membership NFTs become available for purchase. Members will be notified of any changes to fees, and their continued membership will indicate acceptance of these Terms. Membership access may be limited pursuant to nonpayment of required fees and associated costs, and continued use of the Platform serves as your acknowledgement and agreement to that condition.

5. Use of the Platform
The Wildmavins Platform, including all associated content, is intended solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree to use the Platform in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and not to:

Engage in any unauthorized access, hacking, or disruption of the Platform.
Misuse any portion of the Platform for fraudulent or unlawful purposes.
Use any automated systems (e.g., bots) to access the Platform.
6. Wallets, Tokenized Products and Transactions
Creating an account is required to access or use the Platform. To utilize specific Services, such as accessing certain features on our Website or purchasing your membership or product NFT (via credit card, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency) you need to create an account with us or through an approved third-party service.

We will provide a list of the digital wallets we support on our website (the "Website"). Your use of any digital wallet, including those we support or integrate for you during sign up, is at your own risk and governed by the terms and conditions of that wallet provider. You are responsible for all actions taken with your digital wallet, whether by you or someone else. Unless you choose a digital wallet provided by us (via third-party service providers), you are fully responsible for safeguarding your wallet's private key and ensuring its security.

All products available through the Services are tokenized using NFT's, which represent varying degrees of ownership, access, title or rights over specific digital or physical products (e.g., luxury goods). Upon redemption, the token is deemed to have been claimed, inactive or burned, and ownership of the physical product is transferred to you. All purchases, transactions, and redemptions are final.

By participating in tokenized transactions, you acknowledge the risks associated with blockchain technology, including but not limited to market volatility, transaction fees (e.g., gas fees), and potential loss of digital assets. You are not entitled, as a holder of any NFTs, to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of capital shares of the Company for any purpose, nor will anything contained herein be construed to confer on You, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive subscription rights or otherwise.

7. Purchasing, Selling, and Secondary Market Transactions
At specific times determined by us, Wildmavins NFTs or third party creator NFT's will be made available for purchase on our Platform. The pricing of each Wildmavins NFT will be set in either fiat currency value, stablecoin or ETH or through an auction process, as we determine. We cannot guarantee the availability of Wildmavins NFTs at any given time, and we reserve the right to change the type, price, and quantity of available NFTs at our discretion.

Purchasing a Wildmavins NFT can be done via fiat currency or cryptocurrency through our Platform. Regardless of the payment method, you will need a digital wallet to receive the NFT. You can either use a digital wallet you own or opt for one that we generate for you. Please note, we do not take custody or ownership of your Wildmavins NFT.

If you choose to purchase your Wildmavins NFT using cryptocurrency with your personal digital wallet, the NFT will be either pre-minted and transferred or minted directly into that wallet. It is your responsibility to ensure your wallet has sufficient supported cryptocurrency to complete the purchase, including covering any gas fees that may apply.

You understand and accept that if you choose to buy or sell a Wildmavins NFT outside of our Platform, these transactions are at your own risk.

We conduct Know Your Client ("KYC") and anti-money laundering ("AML") checks on certain transactions using third-party services. You acknowledge that failure to successfully pass these checks may restrict your ability to complete certain (or all) transactions on our Platform, and you will have no recourse in such situations.

Gas Fees and Transaction Fees
Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain require the payment of gas fees, which are not controlled by Wildmavins. You are solely responsible for covering these fees during the purchase or sale of any NFTs or tokens. You are obligated to ur third-party service providers (including, but not limited to, Moonpay, Crossmint, Alchemy Pay, Wert) and notifying customers that they will need to comply with and agree to those service providers' terms and conditions in addition to these "Terms." Reserve the right to alter service providers unilaterally.

8. Intellectual Property
All content on the Platform, including but not limited to text, images, graphics, logos, and digital assets (collectively, "Content") is the property of The Runda Lab or its licensors. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Content for personal purposes only. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or otherwise exploit the Content without our explicit prior written consent.

Your purchase of NFTs does not grant you any ownership or intellectual property rights in the digital art, designs, or brand names associated with these tokens, except as explicitly provided.

9. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless The Runda Lab, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and partners (including product or brand owners and creators) from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to:

Your use of the Platform, including any NFT or token related transactions.
Any breach of these Terms.
Any violation of applicable laws or regulations.
Any claim that your use of the Platform infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party.
10. Alcohol and Related Liabilities
When you purchase a Wildmavins NFT, the associated product will remain in a stage of concept or design, in our custody, custody of the distiller, or with one of our trusted partners, until you confirm your acceptance of the product and decide to redeem your NFT for the product ("Redeem").

We will announce the date when you can begin redeeming your Wildmavins NFT ("Redemption Start Date") on our Platform. Additionally, we may set a deadline for redemption ("Redemption End Date"). These dates are subject to change and are not guaranteed.

Important Redemption Information
It is your responsibility to regularly check our Website and Platform for any updates regarding the Redemption Start Date and End Date. At the time of your NFT purchase, these dates may not be available.

Before the Redemption End Date, we may post reminders on our Platform or reach out to you if we have your contact details, but it remains your sole responsibility to monitor these deadlines.

After the Redemption End Date passes, we reserve the right to either burn any non-redeemed Wildmavins NFT associated with the relevant Category Club or make the same non-redeemable, which could include altering the artwork or metadata. We may also mint a new NFT tied to the product.

Wildmavins, nor any of its affiliated companies, are direct producers of alcohol. The Platform, among other things, facilitates the development of bespoke spirits by licensed producers and their distributors, as well as importers of direct-to-consumer spirits. This operational structure ensures compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, as Wildmavins acts as a facilitator in the process, connecting members with unique, curated spirit experiences produced by verified and licensed entities.

Legal Requirements and Warranties
By purchasing a tokenized product representing alcohol (such as spirits), you represent and warrant that you are of legal drinking age and operating in full compliance in your jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that:

You are responsible for ensuring that the person receiving the alcohol product is of legal drinking age.
We are unable to ship products to certain regions. Updated shipping maps will be found the Platform and are subject to change.
Wildmavins, distillers, importers, distributors or retailers do not sell alcohol to any person under the legal drinking age, and will not ship alcohol to jurisdictions where it is prohibited by law.
By arranging the shipping of any alcohol product through our Platform, you are representing that you have obtained or will be liable to obtain all necessary permissions, licenses, and paid all applicable fees for the purchase, shipment, and receipt of alcoholic beverages.
You are responsible for complying with any applicable import and customs laws when redeeming a Wildmavins NFT. If we become aware of any non-compliance, we will not ship the product. By redeeming your NFT, you confirm that the product, including alcohol, is solely for your personal consumption and that the jurisdictions involved allow for the sale and delivery of alcohol.

Wildmavins will not store the product. However, to ensure proper management, if your redemption notices go unresponded for 1 month, we will make efforts to contact you. If you do not respond within 14 business days, or if we cannot reach you, we will contact any backup contact provided. If no backup contact was listed or they do not respond within 14 days, we reserve the right to burn the NFT, rendering it non-redeemable. In such cases, we may reissue the product as a new NFT and auction it on our Platform.

Shipping and Delivery
When a Wildmavins NFT is redeemed, we will handle or arrange for the shipment of the associated product to you. In coordinating the transportation or shipping of the product per your instructions, we act as a service provider on your behalf.

You confirm that you have secured all necessary permissions, paid applicable fees, and engaged appropriately licensed intermediaries where required to receive the product. Ownership of the product transfers to you once your redemption request is approved, at which point the responsibility and risk for the product shift to you. Shipping fees and duties will be the Wildmavins NFT owner's responsibility.

Upon completing the redemption process, you will receive an email with the estimated delivery date. If your product does not arrive as expected, you must notify Wildmavins of any lost shipments within 30 days of receiving our shipping confirmation email.

Wildmavins does not ship products to certain regions based on our discretion. For instance, we do not ship alcohol to jurisdictions where its shipment or consumption is prohibited. A list of restricted areas is available on our Platform. In these cases, Wildmavins may offer reasonable alternatives for redeeming your product in compliance with local laws. These alternatives will be presented during the redemption process.

Please note that no binding agreement to sell or ship any product will exist until we have successfully completed all compliance checks on the individual redeeming the NFT.

In the event that Wildmavins ceases operations, all products will be made available for pickup or shipping in accordance with these Terms.

Additional Indemnification
You further agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless The Runda Lab, its affiliates, and partners from any claims, liabilities, losses, or damages (including legal fees) arising out of:

Any violation of local laws regarding the purchase, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverages.
Any misuse of alcohol-related products by you or any third party.
Any breach of these Terms related to the purchase, sale, or distribution of alcoholic products.
11. No Warranties; Limitation of Liability
THE PLATFORM, SERVICES, THIRD PARTY PORTALS AND ALL INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, AND OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED THROUGH THE PLATFORM AND AFFILIATED ONLINE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF THE SERVICES OR THE PREVENTION FROM LOSS OF, ALTERATION OF, OR IMPROPER ACCESS TO, YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION OR DATA, OR THAT THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES, WORMS OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER RELATING TO OR RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES, LOSS OR MODIFICATION OF CONTENT OR DATA, ERRORS, DEFECTS, MISDELIVERIES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, COMMUNICATION FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY SERVER, RECORDS, PROGRAMS, OR SERVICES, WHETHER OR NOT LIMITED TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

You acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the security of the Platform, the Services, any third party and affiliated and unaffiliated portals or the prevention from loss of, alteration of, or improper access to, your account information or data. Additionally, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access to the Platform and are not responsible for any interruptions, errors, or delays in performance due to factors beyond our control.

You further acknowledge and agree that no data transmissions over the Platform, internet, or any Services can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and consequently, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, The Runda Lab and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Platform, Services, or any products or services obtained through the Platform and/or affiliated with such. Our aggregate liability to you for any claims arising from your use of the Platform is limited to the amount you paid, if any, for access to or use of the Platform.

12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION OF THE TERMS (THE "ARBITRATION AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH WILDMAVINS, ITS PARENT COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, AND THEIR ASSIGNS, AND ALL OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "WILDMAVIN PARTIES"). IT ALSO LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE WILDMAVIN PARTIES.

Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the use of the Website must be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Cayman Islands Mediation and Arbitration Centre ("CI-MAC"), as amended. The arbitration proceedings must be conducted in English, the number of arbitrators must be one, and the seat of arbitration must be located in a mutually convenient location, or if no location can be agreed in the Cayman Islands. The parties must keep the arbitration proceedings confidential and not disclose any information regarding the arbitration to any third party except as required by law.

THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. FURTHER, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING ("CLASS ACTION"). YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION. YOU AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM.

If there is any inconsistency between any term of the CI-MAC Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, the Company agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to your address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending the Company written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to your address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

13. Privacy and Data Security
We are committed to protecting your privacy. Your personal data will be handled in accordance with our privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. We employ appropriate security measures to safeguard your information but cannot guarantee complete security of data transmitted over the internet. Your information is collected to facilitate orders, to complete compliance requirements in accordance with applicable law (Know Your Customer), age verification, and to provide you with additional information in reference to our products and services, as overseen by our Data Protection Officer in compliance with the Cayman Island Data Protection Act.

In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy, the terms of the Privacy Policy shall govern, control and supersede these Terms in reference to any matters of privacy and/or data security.

All of the Company's policies and procedures can be found on our website: https://wildmavins.com/privacy

14. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to conflict of law principles.

15. Termination of Service
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at any time, without prior notice, for any reason, including violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the Platform and any content will be revoked.

16. Force Majeure
We are not responsible for any failure to perform due to unforeseen circumstances or causes beyond our control, including but not limited to war, terrorism, government actions, pandemic, strikes, work shutdowns, natural disasters, embargo, riots, technical failures, earthquakes, hurricanes, sandstorms, tornados, lightening, essential employee work disputes, trade disputes, or acts of God.

17. Miscellaneous
You acknowledge and agree that we, along with our agents, representatives, contractors, suppliers, and any parties acting on our behalf, may implement changes and enhancements to the Platform, Services, and Content at any time. All features, functions, or services may be modified without prior notice and without any liability on our part. It is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and to be aware that accessing our site may not be legal in certain countries or for certain individuals. If we choose not to enforce any provision or right at a particular time, it does not constitute a waiver of that or any other rights.

Should any part of these Terms be deemed unlawful or unenforceable by a court with proper authority, that specific provision will be interpreted in a manner that most closely reflects the original intent of the parties, while the remaining Terms will continue to be in full effect. These Terms represent the entire understanding between you and us on the subject matter, replacing any prior agreements, negotiations, or discussions between the parties.

The Terms are personal to you and cannot be assigned, transferred, or delegated to another party without our explicit written approval. Any attempt to do so without such approval will be considered invalid from the beginning. These Terms will extend to and benefit our successors, assigns, and licensees. Section titles are included for reference purposes only and do not influence the meaning of any provisions.

A. Information You Provide to Us Directly

We may collect personal information when you create an account with us or our service providers (e.g., Privy, Sequence, Moonpay, Crossmint, Shopify), such as name, phone number, time zone, and email address. We may also collect additional personal information, such as your shipping address if you purchase merchandise from us.

Purchases, Wallet and Transaction Information

In order to engage in certain transactions or purchases on the Services, you may need to provide us or our third-party payment processors with your payment information and allow us to connect to your digital wallet by providing us with your public wallet address. We will never ask you or collect your private keys.

Supplemental Identity Verification Information

In order to support Runda's legal and regulatory compliance efforts, Runda may engage third-party identity verification vendors (such as SumSub) in order to verify your identity. These vendors may ask you to submit or request access to your mobile device's camera to collect photographs and/or videos, government-issued identity documents, e.g. passport, driver's license, or state identification card, Social Security number, employment information (e.g. company name), or proof of residency, including visa information, and may also perform a live facial scan and capture other biometric information generated based on photos or videos.

Any collection of biometric information or identifiers is handled by our vendors, and we do not collect, access or store any biometric information or identifiers through our Services. We may receive the results of identity verification checks from our vendors, but these results do not contain any biometric information or identifiers. For more information about SumSub's collection, process, and retention of your personal information (including biometric information and identifiers), please review their policy at https://sumsub.com/privacy-notice-service/

Any personal information you provide on the public sections of these features will be considered "public," (the "User Content") unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other users.

Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain

Transactions involving our NFTs will be conducted on the relevant Protocol. Information about your transfers will be provided to the blockchain and may be accessible to third parties due to the public nature of the blockchain. Because entries to the blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the blockchain could possibly be used to identify you, or information about you. Please note that once your information is uploaded onto or otherwise recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be deleted.

Some of your personal information may be visible to other users of the Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts of the contracts or on a user profile).

We encourage you to closely read each third-party website or third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party websites' or the third­-party applications' processing of your personal information.
